# Solana101

This is a repository made by Texas Blockchain Labs Division in collaboration with
CollegeDAO. It is meant to be a resource for blockchain clubs to use and modify to 
their needs.

## Purpose of Solana101 ##

We don't want to rewrite existing Solana documentation. We want to provide a simple and high-level
overview of the most important concepts you should know when using and developing on Solana.
More detailed (and more technical) information can be found in the resources section of each topic.

We also want to expand open source code and resources for Solana. 

## Intention of Use

The **learn** directory contains information about the Solana blockchain.

The **exercises** directory contains exercises that students can clone and work on to 
apply their learning regarding specific topics. 

The **exercise-solutions** directory contains solutions to the exercises.

The **code-samples** directory is purely community driven and contains code samples 
for anything Solana related.
